## How to stake Kava tokens?

Kava is a Proof of Stake token based on the Tendermint BFT algorithm. Therefore, it allows every Kava token holder to enjoy staking rewards by delegating their token to a Kava Validator.

In this step-by-step guide, we will explain to you how to delegate your KAVA token by using Cosmostation Wallet or Keplr Wallet. Let’s get started!

<figure><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*rb6BWaQNR8eBaTDu76LMsg.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

<figure><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*3tTOVd-1JEn2H4Mf5ph11A.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Next, **Insert your PIN** -> **Confirm your PIN** -> Your personal KAVA wallet

* Please note that there is **no way to recover your PIN** once you lose it. Cosmostation does not store any user information.
* Please remember to keep your generated mnemonic phrase securely in a safe location only accessible to you. **Losing your mnemonic phrase** can lead to loss of your funds, and there is no way for you to recover them.

#### **Step 3: Deposit KAVA to your address**

If you do not have any KAVA in your account, you will need to deposit KAVA to your address to begin making transactions with your account.

<figure><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*BU9Jpe2U8lqXrJlKtwV52Q.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Press the **QR code** icon on the left of your address -> Press “**Copy**” to copy your personal KAVA address.

* Send KAVA to your personal address from another personal address or from an exchange address.
* Please note that Cosmostation Wallet supports **KAVA mainnet** tokens, and not KAVA BEP tokens (KAVA Mainnet addresses start with “KAVA”). **Make sure to check if the wallet you are sending your KAVA from is a KAVA mainnet address.**

#### **Step 4: Delegate your KAVA to validators**

Now that you have KAVA in your account, you can make delegations to validators of your choice to start earning delegation rewards.

<figure><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*hSbq1PAvoydd5g1q2FmcbA.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Press the “**Delegate**” button in the main dashboard -> Press the “**Top**” tab to view the top 100 validators open for delegation -> Select your favourite **validator** — say you pick us **“KysenPool”** and press the “**Delegate**” button.

<figure><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*znhqYHT9HPvQNVo0FAjD2g.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Enter the **amount** you wish to delegate -> Enter **memo** (optional) -> Select **transaction fee** -> **Confirm** Tx detail -> Enter **PIN**

* Please note that you will not be able to make additional transactions (claim rewards, send, etc.) if you delegate your entire available amount. Make sure to leave a minimal amount of KAVA for transaction fees for future transactions.
* Go to the “History” tab in the main dashboard to view your transaction history on [Mintscan](https://kava.mintscan.io/).
* Your total delegated(staked) amount will show up under “delegated” in the main dashboard.

### **Congratulations! You’ve just delegated KAVA to a validator!**

### **How to Stake KAVA Tokens?**

When you are all set it is time to learn how to stake KAVA.

KAVA holders can earn staking rewards, thereby increasing their KAVA holdings by simply staking their KAVA tokens with any one of the active validators on the network.

To stake KAVA tokens you must first buy some KAVA tokens and send them to a wallet that supports staking.

Once you’ve transferred your tokens to a stake-supporting wallet, you may proceed with staking your tokens on the network to earn staking rewards.

First, open your Keplr extension and press `Stake`
