***

## Staking your BLD tokens with Keplr wallet

### **Installing Keplr to Activate a Wallet**

Using a browser such as [**Google Chrome**](https://www.google.com/chrome/) or [**Brave**](https://brave.com/)

1. Visit the [**Chrome Web Store**](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/keplr/dmkamcknogkgcdfhhbddcghachkejeap) to **Add to Chrome**
2. Add ‚ÄúKeplr‚Äù window will appear. Here's when you choose to **Add Extension**.
3. When the download completes, you can begin interacting with your browser extension by clicking on it at the top right corner of your browser
4. You'll now launch the Keplr wallet extension and will see the following 3 options

## **Creating a new wallet**

### **How to create a new Account via Recovery Phrase**

1. If you are setting up Keplr for the first time: In the initial pop-up window, choose Create new recovery phrase.
2. **Choose to have a recovery phrase of 24 words, then take care to save them. The safest way is to write the words on paper and store them in a secure place. Avoid taking screenshots of the words or copying them into your computer/phone notes.**
3. To confirm the creation of the new account, all you have to do is key in the words in the right order in which they appear in your recovery phrase, enter a name for your account, and **set your password. Choose carefully, if possible, prefer a password you‚Äôre not using in any other application, and then click Next.** If you have used Keplr before, this step will be skipped as you have already set your name and password when creating/importing your first account.

## **How to Stake BLD Tokens?**

When you are all set it is time to learn how to stake BLD tokens.

BLD holders can earn staking rewards, thereby increasing their BLD holdings by simply staking their BLD tokens with any one of the active validators on the network.

To stake BLD tokens you must first have some BLD tokens and send them to a wallet that supports staking.

Once you‚Äôve transferred your tokens to a stake-supporting wallet, you may proceed with staking your tokens on the network to earn staking rewards.

First, visit [https://wallet.keplr.app/chains/agoric](https://wallet.keplr.app/chains/agoric).

Select a validator of your choice to stake your tokens to.

Once you have made your decision of validator, click >, then Stake.

**In order to improve decentralization, please consider staking to out of top 10 validator.**

Next step is to decide and key in the number of BLD tokens you want to stake in the input field and click Stake.

**IMPORTANT: Do not stake all of your token, you need to save some to pay for network fees.**
