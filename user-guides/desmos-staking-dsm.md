As one of the validators elected during the first epoch,  [**KysenPool**](https://www.kysenpool.io/en/kysenpool) is fully geared up to accept DSM delegation! DSM holders can start to delegate your token to validator and earn rewards!

In this step-by-step guide, we will explain to you how to delegate your DSM on _Forbole X_. Delegating your _DSM_ to validators could help securing the operations of Desmos blockchain and earn you rewards periodically. Let‚Äôs get started!

## Download and Install Forbole X

First, visit Forbole X at [https://x.forbole.com](https://x.forbole.com). Forbole X wallet extension is now available on [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/forbole-x/fmblappgoiilbgafhjklehhfifbdocee). You can download and install it directly on your **Brave** and **Chrome** browsers now.

## Setting Up Your Wallet

Press **`Get Started`**

<figure><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*InuIEC_aJ5lrJQtv64FWWw.png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Click ‚ÄúGet Started‚Äù to import or create your first wallet.</p></figcaption></figure>

Set an **`Application Password`** and confirm it, you would be asked to enter this password whenever you access Forbole X application to view any of your data. Please store your password safely because it could not be restored and you will have to import all your wallets again.

<figure><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*7QNJLnCtz0vFD7CAFsgy2w.png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Set a password to protect your application</p></figcaption></figure>

Now, you can import your existing wallets or create a new wallet.

<figure><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*edGmKSrwPmtEq44Blv4MDg.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

By clicking **`Create Wallet`**, please follow the screen instructions and safe guard the Secret Recovery Phrase (Mnemonic Phrase). It‚Äôs the ONLY WAY to restore your account.

<figure><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*aawPbsqLSobQTx7NhyApPw.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Let‚Äôs continue by clicking **`Import Wallet`** to import an existing wallet.

There are 3 different ways to import an existing wallet. If you have an existing Secret Recovery Phrase (Mnemonic Phrase) and decided to store the wallet locally in the web extension, you can choose the 1st option and continue or 3rd option to connect with Ledger Hardware Wallet.

Assume you have clicked the 1st option, Forbole X will ask you to restore the wallet from your Secret Recovery Phrase. Input the 24-word phrase and continue.

<figure><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*qTfsQzmwnYpqD5JIr6ldow.png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Enter the Secret Recovery Phrase</p></figcaption></figure>

After importing the wallet, set a password to secure your wallet. You will need to enter it to access this wallet in order to execute any transactions. Each wallet will have its own **`Security Password`** (v.s. the `Application Password` in first step) for the key encryption.

After that, choose DSM as the token you would like to import and set a moniker for your wallet.

<figure><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*bXn14qRScbHYCwKHwj0-Gw.png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Let‚Äôs call this wallet ‚ÄúKysenPool‚Äù (Moniker : set your own wallet name)</p></figcaption></figure>

**Congratulations!** You have successfully imported your wallet!

Beside the wallets, you can give every account a specific moniker. Some people would like to refer their accounts based on their purpose. Let‚Äôs update the moniker of this account now by clicking the icon on the right. This account is for personal earnings. I‚Äôm going to call it `DSM Earnings`.

## Using Ledger Nano S/X devices

_Forbole X_ supports _Ledger Nano_ hardware wallets.

Desmos DSM holders can interact with their Desmos accounts securely using Ledger hardware wallet.

> Before installing Desmos Ledger app, please make sure that you are using the **latest Ledger Live** and your Ledger device has been updated with the **latest firmware**.

### **Download Desmos Ledger App from Ledger Live**

The Desmos Ledger App can be downloaded from the Ledger Live with ‚ÄúDeveloper Mode‚Äù enabled. You can turn it on by visiting

`Settings` `>` `Experimental Features`

<figure><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*zWDZDJey_IRiGcmaeycaSg.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Once ‚ÄúDeveloper Mode‚Äù is enabled, you will see ‚ÄúExperimental‚Äù on the left bottom corner of your Ledger Live window. You can then visit ‚ÄúManager‚Äù and search for ‚ÄúDesmos‚Äù. You will be able to install the Desmos Ledger App in the search result.

If you cannot find **`Desmos`** in the **`App catalog`** on Ledger Live, please check again if you have enabled **`Developer Mode`** and update the latest version of firmware.

<figure><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*y_A1oNv2-ue37jnoQ3ic7A.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

After the installation is done, you will see the Desmos Ledger app on your Ledger device.

<figure><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*8mWXYcGJiVsey09XlM8u-w.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Next, let import another wallet via a _Ledger Nano_ device. Go back **`Wallets`** page and click **`Add Wallet`**. You will see the following window again. We choose the 3rd Option, **`Connect with Ledger Hardware Wallet`**, this time.

<figure><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*aFY6hrPY0w9TfFCx88-rAw.png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Import a wallet via Ledger Nano device</p></figcaption></figure>

The process is similar to import a wallet with **`Secret Recovery Phrase`** but Forbole X will prompt you to open **`Desmos`** Ledger app this time.

<figure><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*HVI2BV8SYE35c3hZooyS9w.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

After importing the wallet, the default first account is added. You can again edit the moniker of the account by clicking the triple-dot ‚Äú`‚Ä¶`‚Äù context menu.

<figure><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*Ek3eKxZlRBEoUQtEdrb7zg.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

You can set meaningful moniker to your accounts. You can also favorite your accounts by using the star ‚≠ê button, so that you can access them easily from the left menu‚Äôs **`Starred Accounts`**.

<figure><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*_e9WXuSJJWMkvgUcguEZAQ.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Now, you can get a glance of your accounts by visiting the **`Portfolio`** page.

<figure><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*Zw-NgpLHXruG-VAZcVAC0w.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

> There is always an Experience from The Dark Side.
