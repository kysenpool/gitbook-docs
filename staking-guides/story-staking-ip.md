<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2025-09-19 at 9.01.38‚ÄØPM.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Story is building the infrastructure for the onchain IP economy, making intellectual property programmable, investable, and accessible. By staking **$IP**, you don‚Äôt just earn rewards ‚Äî you actively support the growth of a sustainable ecosystem for creators, investors, and builders.

In this post, we‚Äôll walk you through everything you need to know about staking your IP tokens.

***

### üîπ Why Stake IP?

Staking IP tokens helps secure the Story network and aligns you with its long-term vision. Benefits include:

* **Earn Rewards**: Receive staking rewards in $IP for contributing to network security.
* **Support the Ecosystem**: Stakers strengthen Story‚Äôs decentralized infrastructure.
* **Participate in Governance**: Depending on the roadmap, stakers may have a voice in shaping future upgrades and policies.

### üîπ What You‚Äôll Need

Before staking, make sure you have:

1. **IP Tokens** in your wallet.
2. A **compatible wallet** (e.g., MetaMask or any Story-supported wallet).

***

### üîπ How to Stake IP Tokens

Follow these simple steps:

#### **1. Visit the Staking Dashboard**

#### 2. Connect Your Wallet

Click **‚ÄúConnect Wallet‚Äù** and select your preferred option (e.g., MetaMask or any Story-supported wallet). Approve the connection.

#### 3. Choose a Validator

Browse the list of Story validators. Validators help secure the network, and their performance can impact your staking rewards. (Let‚Äôs say you pick us, **KysenPool:** [https://staking.story.foundation/validators/0x3e13a106de45bc493bed240913dd3f501af0beac](https://staking.story.foundation/validators/0x3e13a106de45bc493bed240913dd3f501af0beac))

üëâ Tip: Look for validators with strong uptime and fair commission rates.

#### 4. Enter the Amount to Stake

Select how many IP tokens you‚Äôd like to delegate. (Minimum Stake Amount is 1024 IP)

Remember: Locked token staking incurs 0.5x rewards. If you do not intend to stake on a locked token validator, please stake on a validator that supports unlocked tokens.

#### 5. Confirm and Stake

Review the details, approve the transaction in your wallet, and confirm. Once processed, your tokens are officially staked!

**Congratulations! You‚Äôve just delegated IP tokens to a validator.**

***

### üîπ Monitoring Your Staking

After staking, you can:

* Click **"My Delegations"** at the top bar on the staking dashboard to track your delegations in real time.
* Click **"My Transactions"** at the top bar on the staking dashboard to track your transactions in real time.

### üîπ Final Thoughts

Staking your IP tokens is more than just earning yield ‚Äî it‚Äôs your way of fueling the Story ecosystem and powering the future of the onchain IP economy.

As Story continues to expand, staking will play an increasingly important role in governance, ecosystem growth, and aligning incentives between creators, builders, and investors.

Start staking today, and be part of building the next chapter of the internet economy. üåê
