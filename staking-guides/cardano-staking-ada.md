## Introduction

Staking **Cardano (ADA)** allows users to participate in the network‚Äôs proof-of-stake (PoS) mechanism while earning rewards. Unlike traditional mining, staking is energy-efficient and enables ADA holders to support the network securely. This guide covers staking ADA using three popular wallets: **Daedalus, Yoroi, and Lace Wallet**.
