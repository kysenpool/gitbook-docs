Staking Harmony‚Äôs ONE token is one of the best ways to participate in the network, support decentralization, and earn rewards while holding your tokens. Whether you‚Äôre a long-term believer in Harmony or just getting started with staking, this step-by-step guide will walk you through everything you need to know.

***

### üåê What is Harmony ONE Staking?

Harmony is a fast and secure blockchain designed for decentralized applications. Its native token, **ONE**, powers the network by securing transactions through staking. By delegating your tokens to validators, you help maintain network security and performance ‚Äî in return, you earn staking rewards.

***

### üîë What You Need Before Staking

Before you can start staking ONE, make sure you have:

1. **ONE Tokens** ‚Äî Purchase ONE on exchanges like Binance, KuCoin, or Crypto.com, then transfer them to your wallet.
2. **A Wallet that Supports Staking** ‚Äî The most popular choice is the Harmony One Wallet, but wallets like MetaMask (configured for Harmony) or Ledger hardware wallets also work.
3. **A Validator to Delegate To** ‚Äî Validators run nodes and secure the blockchain. As a delegator, you choose who to support.

### üõ† Step-by-Step: How to Stake ONE

#### Step 1: Set Up Your Wallet

* Install the **Harmony One Wallet extension** or configure MetaMask for the Harmony network.
* Fund your wallet by sending ONE tokens from an exchange.

* For better decentralization, avoid staking only with the largest validators.

#### Step 4: Delegate Your ONE

* Click on your chosen validator.

**Congratulations! You‚Äôve just delegated ONE tokens to a validator.**

### üí∞ Rewards & Unstaking

* **Rewards**: Staking rewards are automatically added to your account. You can claim them anytime.
* **Unstaking**: If you want to withdraw your tokens, you‚Äôll need to **undelegate**. Harmony has a **7-epochs unbonding period** before your tokens become available again.

### üöÄ Why Stake ONE?

By staking your ONE tokens, you‚Äôre doing more than just earning passive rewards ‚Äî you‚Äôre actively contributing to Harmony‚Äôs mission of building a **scalable, sustainable, and community-driven blockchain ecosystem**.

Start staking today, and let your ONE tokens work for you while strengthening the Harmony network.
