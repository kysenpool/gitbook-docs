## **What is QUICKSILVER?**

Quicksilver is a sovereign Cosmos-SDK zone that provides liquid staking for the Interchain. It can scale to onboard a limitless number of zones with zero onboarding effort required from zones and validators.

The Quicksilver native token, with the ticker QCK, has these specific roles: governance, security and payment of on-chain fees.

To stake QCK tokens you must first to have your QCK tokens either airdrop for supported chain stakers(exp: Stargaze stakers)/qAssets stakers or get QCK tokens from Decentralized Exchange (exp: [https://app.osmosis.zone](https://app.osmosis.zone)) and send them to a wallet that supports staking.
